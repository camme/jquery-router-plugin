# jquery router plugin
This plugin handles routes for both hash and push state.

Why? Why another routing plugin? Because i couldn't find one that handles both hash and pushstate.

### How to add routes

To add route you simply call the add function, providing it with the actual route string, an optional id, and the callback. 

$.router.add(*route*, *[id]*, *callback*);
	
Example:

	// Adds a route for /items/:item and calls the callback when matched
	$.router.add(/items/:item", function(data) {
		console.log(data.item);
	});

or

	// Adds a route for /items/:item and calls the callback when matched, but also has
	// a reference to the routes id in $.router.currentId
	$.router.add(/items/:item", "foo", function(data) {
		console.log(data.item);
	});

### How to change urls and trigger routes
You can also change the current url to a route, and thereby triggering the route by calling *go*.

$.router.go(url, title);

Example:
	
	// This will change the url to http://www.foo.com/items/mycoolitem and set the title to
	// "My cool item" without reloading the page. If using hashes instead, it will use the url
	// http://www.foo.com/#!items/mycoolitem.
	// If a route has been set that matches it, it will be triggered.
	$.router.go("/items/mycoolitem", "My cool item");

### How to check if a route is defined
You can check if an url is defined into the router. Useful to differentiate between links to other websites from the internal ones.

$.router.checkURL("/some_url")

Example:

    // This will enable all but external links in a page to be managed through the router
    $('a').click(function(e) {
      var url;
      url = $(this).attr('href');
      if ($.router.checkRoute(url)) {
        $.router.go(url);
        e.preventDefault();
        return false;
      }
    });
	
### Reseting all routes

If you need to remove all routes (which is good when testing) you just call:

$.router.reset();
